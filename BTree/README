README

This is a templatized BTree created for my Data Structures class in the Fall of 2012.

It takes one input parameter, the filename of the input file (btreeprojectdataexample.txt is the given example of this file). 

In this file, commands are specified such as L: for loading input data into the BTree (the main.cc assumes that the input will be an int), D: for deleting a value from the tree, etc.
